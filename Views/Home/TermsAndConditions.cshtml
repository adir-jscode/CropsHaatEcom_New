                2.C. MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICE CONDITIONS OR ALTERATIONS AND RELATED
                PROMISES
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to make changes to the Site, its policies, these terms
            and conditions, and any other publicly displayed condition or service
            promise at any time, and you will be bound by the policies and terms and
            conditions in effect at the time you used the Site, unless a change to
            those policies or these conditions is required by law or government
            authority (in which case it will apply to orders you have already placed).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2.D. COMMUNICATION BUY/SALE PLATFORM</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You agree, understand, and acknowledge that the Site is an online Buy/Sale
            Platform that allows you to Buy/Sale Crops/Process Crops listed at the
            price indicated at any time from any location using a payment method of
            your choice, and that we are only a facilitator and cannot be a party to or
            control in any way any transactions on the Site or on a payment gateway
            made available to you by an independent service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2.E. COMPLAINTS FOR INFRINGING CONTENT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you believe your intellectual property rights have been infringed upon,
            please contact us at founder@cropshaat.com or cto@cropshaat.com, and we
            will make all reasonable efforts to resolve your concern within a
            reasonable amount of time. Please include your name, address, contact
            information, and as many relevant details of the claim as possible,
            including the name of the infringing party.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also respect a manufacturer's right to enter into exclusive distribution
            or resale agreements for its Crops/Process Crops; however, violations of
            such agreements do not constitute intellectual property rights
            infringement, and we would not be able to assist in the enforcement of such
            agreements because it is a matter between the manufacturer, distributor,
            and/or respective reseller.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2.F. REPRESENTATIONS AGAINST OBJECTIVE CONTENT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We list a lot of Crops/Process Crops for Buy/Sale on the Site from a lot of
            sellers/buyers, and we host a lot of comments on listings, so we operate on
            a "claim, review, and takedown" basis. If you believe that any content on
            the Site is illegal, offensive (including but not limited to material that
            is sexually explicit), or misleading, please contact us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please make sure to include your name, address, and contact information, as
            well as many relevant claim details as possible, such as the name of the
            objectionable content party, instances of objection, and proof of
            objection, among other things. Failure to do so will render your claim
            invalid and unusable for legal purposes.

                CROPS
            </strong>
            OR SERVICE
        </p>
        <p>
            This section covers the terms and conditions for purchasing/selling
            crops/process crops or services on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3.B. ORDER PROCESSING, PRICES, AND AVAILABILITY</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            All prices are in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) and include VAT. They are posted
            on the Site by the vendor of the Crops/Process Crops or service. The most
            current price shown on the item's Crops/Process Crops detail page will
            always be reflected in your Shopping Cart. Please keep in mind that this
            price may change from the one shown when you originally added the item to
            your basket. Adding an item to your basket does not guarantee the price
            shown at the moment. It's also conceivable that the price of an item will
            drop between the time you add it to your shopping cart and the moment you
            Buy/Sale it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not match prices for items purchased or sold by any seller on our
            Site or other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are committed to providing our visitors with the most accurate pricing
            information on the Site; but, mistakes may occur, such as when an item's
            price is incorrectly listed on the Site. As a result, we retain the right
            to reject or cancel any purchase without explanation. If an item's pricing
            is incorrect, we may, at our option, contact you for instructions or cancel
            your purchase and inform you of the cancellation. Whether or not the
            purchase has been confirmed and your money has been completed, we have the
            right to reject or cancel any such orders. In the event that your prepaid
            purchase is canceled, our refund rules will apply. Please keep in mind that
            Crops Haat owns the whole return money. The amount of the refund is usually
            computed based on the price paid by the consumer after any discounts and
            shipping fees have been deducted.
        </p>
        <p>
            On each Crops/Process Crops information page, we give availability
            information for the Crops/Process Crops mentioned on the Site. We can't be
            more explicit about availability than what we mention on that page or
            elsewhere on the Site. Please keep in mind that dispatch estimates are just
            that: estimates. They are not promised delivery timeframes and should not
            be used as such. If any of the Crops/Complete Crops you ordered turn out to
            be unavailable, you will be notified by e-mail or SMS as we process your
            order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please keep in mind that orders may be unable to be completed for a variety
            of reasons. At any time, the Site reserves the right to refuse or cancel
            any order for any reason. Before we accept your purchase, you may be
            required to submit further verifications or information, such as your phone
            number and address.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to request validation of your payment details before
            supplying you with the Crops/Process Crops and to validate the personal
            information you submitted with us in order to prevent any credit or debit
            card fraud. This verification might take the form of an identification
            check, a check of where you live, or a check of your financial information.
            In the absence of a response to such an enquiry, the order will be
            immediately canceled within a reasonable time frame. We retain the right to
            cancel an order directly if we perceive a risk of fraudulent use of banking
            instruments or for other reasons, without providing previous notification
            or incurring any legal duty.

            <strong>3.G. THE AGREEMENT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your order is a legally binding offer to purchase the Crops/Process Crops
            or service offered on our Site from the vendor. When you make an order to
            Buy/Sale/Process Crops, any confirmations or status updates you get prior
            to the shipping of your order are only for the purpose of validating the
            order data you gave and do not imply that the order has been confirmed.
            When the Crops/Process Crops are shipped to you, your order acceptance is
            deemed confirmed. You may get different dispatch confirmations if your
            purchase is sent in several packages. We give an estimated schedule for the
            processing of your purchase when you place your order, but we cannot
            guarantee that this timeline will be strictly adhered to in all cases since
            we rely on third-party service providers to keep this pledge. We pledge to
            you that we will make every reasonable attempt to meet the estimated
